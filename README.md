# zimp
Zimp, the JavaScript frontend framework with simple space based syntax.

Zimp or Zeuz’s Indentation Media Page is a frontend framework that specializes in simplicity in creating basic UI components into the DOM. The main features include no semicolons, space based syntax, out of the box routing, and some other cool stuff. This framework is still very much in early access but it’s in a slightly functional bare bones state so many features are coming soon.

# Getting started

To get started with a Zimp web application, run this command:

```
npx create-zimp-app
```
From there follow the instructions to run the demo project.
